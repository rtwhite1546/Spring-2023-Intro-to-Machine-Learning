    "# MTH 4224 / CSE 4224 - Python Assignment + Homework 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline**: Jan 30, 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "**Points**: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: I did give some hints, but I did not teach about every built-in function you're going to need to use. This will *always* be the situation in real life. Be resourceful, read the documentation, Google your errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Academic Honesty**: Write your code from scratch. Learn from the Internet, talk to friends, ask me questions, but don't just copy blocks of code. Every submission I grade should be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit **one** Python notebook file for grading. Your file must include **text explanations** of your work, **well-commented code**, and the **outputs** from your code.\n",

    "For this problem, use the text of [*The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm) by Arthur Conan Doyle.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Find a probability distribution of the letters in the text and plot it as a bar graph. (What % of letters are 'a', what % of letters are 'b', ...?)\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Find a probability distribution of only the first letters of words. Plot it with the plot from part (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Find and rank the top 10 most commonly occurring bigraphs in the text. (Bigraphs are 2-letter pairs *appearing within individual words*.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Do the same for trigraphs. (Trigraphs 3-letter groupings *appearing within individual words*.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) The following text from a certain book was encoded by shuffling the alphabet. Use what you learned in (a)-(d) to decode it and find the source of the text. Explain your reasoning in words.\n",

    "Ridge regression is am modified version of linear regression that penelizes the coefficients for being large. It accomplishes this by adding a so-called $L^2$ penalty term to the loss function (e.g. mean squared error):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\left(\\hat{f}(x_i)-y_i\\right)^2 + \\lambda\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^d \\theta_i^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda>0$ is a **hyperparameter** that must be tuned by the user. An appropriate choice of $\\lambda$ can often help with learning datasets where the input features are highly correlated or it can help with an overfitting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Write each part of $L(\\theta)$ in matrix-vector form where $\\hat{f}$ is a LBF expansion regression model. Define each matrix and vector separately by writing their elements with subscripts, and state their dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Solve the following optimization problem by hand for the loss function $L$ above:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min\\limits_{\\theta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}} L(\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Write a Python class for this ridge LBF expansion regression model with a `fit` function applying the formula from part (b) to compute the parameters $\\theta$ and a `predict` function to make predictions for input data after the model has been fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Apply this class to fit a LBF regression model to predicting real estate prices based on the 6 input features in the [Real estate valuation dataset on the UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real+estate+valuation+data+set).\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Test at least 3 different LBF expansions (best-fit hyperplane, best-fit quadratic surface, and an alternative one of your choice), each with at least 5 different values of the hypereparameter $\\lambda$. (You should have at least 15 experiments.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Document all experiments and conclude which experiment works best based on an appropriate train/test split. Report your best test-set MAE at the end of your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The best two models in the class will earn +5 bonus points. (You must turn in your work on time to be eligible.)**"
